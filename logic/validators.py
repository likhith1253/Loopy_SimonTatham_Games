            # Let's count active edges. If the closed loop length < current active edges + 1,
            # it implies there are disjoint edges elsewhere, so this loop isolates them.
            # That's a "Premature Loop" (since we want a Single Loop).
            
            # Get path length? Overkill.

            # closing a loop is fine ONLY IF it connects the 'ends' of the line.
            # But Slitherlink can have multiple segments during play.
            
            # STRICT RULE: A move is invalid if it creates a CLOSED LOOP that does not
            # include ALL currently active edges.
            # Actually, even simpler:
            # If we create a closed loop, we must have NO loose ends left anywhere else.
            
            # Let's trust the validator to be called.
            # For now, we will ALLOW closing loops, but the GameState win checker
            # will tell us if we won.
            # BUT, the prompt asks to "Prevent Premature Loop".
            # So: If forming a cycle, check if (num_edges_in_cycle == total_edges_after_move).
            # If not, it means we have edges outside the cycle -> Invalid Premature Loop.
            
            # To do this efficiently:
            # 1. Check reachability (u -> v)
            # 2. If reachable, we are closing a loop.
            # 3. Check if any other component exists.
            #    If we are closing the loop, the new component count should be 1.
            #    Actually, if u and v are in the same component, adding edge keeps count same.
            #    If they were disjoint, count decreases.
