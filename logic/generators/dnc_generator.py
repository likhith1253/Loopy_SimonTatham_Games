Divide & Conquer Puzzle Generator
=================================
Generates Slitherlink puzzles using a structural decomposition approach.

Algorithm:
1. Spatial Decomposition: Recursively divide grid into quadrants.
2. Base Case: Generate small valid loop segments in 2x2 or 3x3 regions.
3. Merge: Stitch regions together by connecting boundary edges to form a single global loop.
4. Validation: Use AdvancedDPSolver to ensure uniqueness and validity.
