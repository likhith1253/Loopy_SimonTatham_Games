"""
Strategy Controller
===================
Hierarchical orchestration layer for CPU move selection.

Rules:
- Keep solver implementations pure.
- In DP mode: call ONLY the DP solver (no fallback chain).
- In Advanced DP mode: Advanced DP -> DP -> D&C -> Greedy fallback.
- In D&C mode: D&C solver -> Greedy fallback.
- In Greedy mode: Greedy solver only.
- Re-evaluate full priority order on every CPU turn.
