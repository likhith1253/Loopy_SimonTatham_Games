"""
Live Analysis Service
=====================
Runs all three solvers (Greedy, D&C, DP) on isolated board clones
and records their move choice, execution time, and states explored.

Correctness guarantees:
- Each solver gets a deep-copied board state (no shared mutable objects).
- Solver APIs match the real game flow exactly:
  Greedy -> decide_move(), D&C -> solve(), DP -> solve().
- Results are appended to game_state.live_analysis_table.
- Move numbering is derived from the table length (no internal counter).
